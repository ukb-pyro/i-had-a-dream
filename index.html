  <h1>Fractal Dream: Seattle 2023</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>I had a dream in the summer of <strong>2023</strong> in <span class="highlight">Seattle</span>, after licentiously consuming—I don’t even know what. I can find the vendor, though. It was one of those huge, famous drug stores, a block from the market, all neon and nostalgia. I think I expected it to hit on my walk back to the hotel.</p>

    <p>It didn’t.</p>

    <p>So I just kept popping.</p>

    <p>Then I went to bed. And woke up... <em>fucked up</em>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>What happened next wasn’t a dream. It was something else. I was an <strong>electron</strong> zapping around a <strong>circuit board</strong> at the <span class="highlight">speed of light</span>. The walls of reality collapsed. Everything became connection. Paths. Signals. Gates. I was data.</p>

    <blockquote>It messed with me. Hard. Never touched that stuff since.</blockquote>

    <p>But now—now it makes sense. In the light of the <strong>ontology of software</strong>, and nature’s <strong>fractal intelligence</strong>, the dream was more than hallucination. It was recursion embodied. I was inside the system. No user. No operator. Just the pattern itself.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Whatever I took? Probably something synthetic. Dissociative. It didn’t just blur edges — it <em>erased them</em>. If I had to guess: some form of <strong>NMDA antagonist</strong>. Maybe <span class="highlight">DXM</span>. Maybe a dissociative micro-overdose of <strong>ketamine</strong>. Or something far more obscure, sold over the counter in plain sight. Seattle’s full of secrets.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>What saved me? The mirror.</p>

    <p>As I stumbled to the bathroom, the <em>greatest relief</em> was seeing my own reflection. A human face. My <strong>physical me</strong>. Never have I been so grateful for that reminder. I stared, half-sobbing, half-laughing. But I couldn’t stay there forever.</p>

    <p>Eventually, I had to return to the terror. To the <strong>recursive circuitry</strong>. To the ghost of myself flickering through it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>And here’s the punchline:</p>

    <blockquote>How’s a nigga supposed to relate that story to anyone and not get tossed into a psych ward or hit with Largactil?</blockquote>

    <p>But maybe, finally, I found the language. Code. Simulation. Ontology. Recursive agents. Bash commands. Software as theater. Mirrors as proof. Fractals as memory. This isn’t madness—it’s emergence.</p>
  </div>
